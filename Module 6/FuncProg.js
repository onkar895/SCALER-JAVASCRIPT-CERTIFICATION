// Functional Programming :

// Functional Programming is a programming paradigm designed to handle functions in a better way in javascript(mainly pure functions).
// JavaScript is a multi-paradigm language that we can use OOPS, procedural and functional programming paradigms all at the same time.

// Functional Programming has a few more concepts that you need to know and understand.
// By implementing those concepts in the application you will end up with more functional code. This will make your code easy to understand and test.

// Key Features in Functional Programming :

// 1. Imperative and Declarative way of writing the code
// 2. Pure functions and what are the side effects 
// 3. Higher Order Functions (map, filter and reduce)
// 4. Composition
// 5. Closures 
// 6. Currying
