// use strict : 
// In JavaScript, the "use strict" directive is used to enable a stricter set of rules and error-checking during the execution of code. 
// When you include "use strict" at the beginning of a script or a function, it changes the way JavaScript behaves by catching common coding errors and preventing the use of certain features that are considered error - prone or deprecated.

'use strict'
a = 10
console.log(a) // error when using strict

let b = 10
console.log(a)
